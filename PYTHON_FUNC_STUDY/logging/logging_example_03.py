The Five Levels of Logging
DEBUG: It is used for diagnosing the problem. It gives a piece of detailed information about the problem.
       The severity level is 10.
INFO: It gives the confirmation message of the successful execution of the program.
      The severity level is 20.
WARNING: The message is for when an unexpected situation occurs.
         The severity level is 30.
ERROR: It is due to a more serious problem than a warning. It can be due to some inbuilt error Like
       syntax or logical error.
       The severity level is 40.
CRITICAL: It occurs when the program execution stops and it can not run itself anymore.
          The severity level is 50.

We can Print the DEBUG and INFO message too by changing the basic configuration of the logger with
the help of basicConfig(**kwargs)
There are some parameters that are commonly used in this â€”
level: To change the root logger to a specified severity level.
filename: Filename where the logs going to be stored.
filemode: If a filename is given then this specifies the file mode in which the file will open. default is append (a )
format: This is the format of the log message.
datefmt : It specified the date and time format.
