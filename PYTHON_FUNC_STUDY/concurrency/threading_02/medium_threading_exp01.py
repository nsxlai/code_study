This article is NOT recommending using threading to do any CPU intensive task due to GIL limitation.
There is not significant benefit for doing so:

'This demonstrates the effect of the GIL on programs running in the standard CPython interpreter.
Therefore itâ€™s not recommended to use multithreading for CPU intensive tasks in Python.'
