Questions 1
Design a banking class
1. Keep track of the customer name, email, and account number
2. Keep the account balance for the customer
3. Create deposit and withdraw method

Question 2
Design code logic to determine which test sequence to execute at run time?

    Pseudo-code:
    if UUT needs to run 2C:
        run sequence_1
    else:
        run sequence_2

    sequence_1:
        init()
        boot()
        run_bst()
        run_2c()
        reboot()
        run sysft()
        cleanup()

    sequence_2
        init()
        boot()
        run_bst()
        run sysft()
        cleanup()

Question 3: Use the factory design pattern for the following code
class carA:
    def __init__(self, color, style=sedan)
        self.color = color
        self.style = style

    def car_info(self):
        print(f'This car is {self.color} with {style} body style')

class carB:
    def __init__(self, color, style=SUV)
        self.color = color
        self.style = style

    def car_info(self):
        print(f'This car is {self.color} with {style} body style')


Question 4: Write a decorator to measure the time elapse for a function

def boot_up():
    sleep(4)
    return 'UUT is booted'

Question 5: How to read a file and display its content?
